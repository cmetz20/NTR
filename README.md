Nick's TV Repair Scripts

This repository contains scripts used for Nick's TV Repair in Tucson, AZ.

Some of these scripts are used as cron jobs for automation purposes to aid in things like intake and processing of customer orders.
Other scripts are used in conjunction with the Nickstvs.com website in order to connect the front-end of the website to the back-end of the site including database usage and other topics such as sending emails via PHPMailer.

These scripts are written by Christopher Metz and are written for the use of Nick's TV Repair.
